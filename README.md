# Employee-Attrition

The issue of keeping one's employees happy and satisfied is a perennial and age-old challenge. If an employee you have invested so much time and money leaves for "greener pastures", then this would mean that you would have to spend even more time and money to hire somebody else. In the spirit of Kaggle, let us therefore turn to our predictive modelling capabilities and see if we can predict employee attrition on this synthetically generated IBM dataset.

This notebook is structured as follows:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis : In this section, we explore the dataset by taking a look at the feature distributions, how correlated one feature is to the other and create some Seaborn and Matplotlib visualisations
2. Feature Engineering and Categorical Encoding : Conduct some feature engineering as well as encode all our categorical features into dummy variables
3. Implementing Machine Learning models : We implement different ML models including Random Forest, XGB Classifier, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, ANN, etc.,  after which we look at feature importances from these respective models. ( Logistic Regression have higher accuracy )
